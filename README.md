# YoutubeVid2Invidious
a firefox extension to redirect youtube videos to invidious, but not in a stupid way.

install the addon into your firefox, and now when you go to youtube you can browse it like normal and when you 
click on a youtube video or open up a youtube video in a new tab, it will simply redirect the video to an invidious 
mirror of your choosing! the default mirror is set up as yew.tube, but you're able to change it to whatever mirror 
you like in the preferences for the addon. go into your 'about:addons', choose the 'Youtube Video to Invidious' 
addon and move to the Preferences tab underneath the addon. from there, you just need to paste in your mirror 
of choice's full URL followed by the "/watch?v=" crap. the easiest way to get this if you're unsure is to just 
open up a video on your preferred Invidious mirror, and copy the url in the address bar and paste that in the box, 
excluding the actual ID of the video after the "/watch?v=" bit.

example:
https://iv.ggtyler.dev/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ > https://iv.ggtyler.dev/watch?v=
and
https://onion.tube/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ > https://onion.tube/watch?v=

hit save, and now when you open up youtube videos, it should change the URL to that, and slap the video ID at the end.
